## ‚≠ê Password Hashing in Node.js Using bcryptjs Library.

Here's the picture, You are creating your web application that takes in user information, It could be things such as Credit Card Number, National Identification Number, or even Password e.t.c But when you save it, you still get the raw user data being stored exactly the way it has been inputted. How do we go about hashing certain user information so that we can better secure our data?

Data like these are typically stored in a database, and we need a way to encrypt such data so that it doesn't become easily accessible. Even If someone were to hack our database, all they would see is just a bunch of hashed data they can't do anything with.

## ‚≠ê Why we use ?

We use bcryptjs for hashing passwords in situations where security is paramount, such as user authentication systems. Hashing passwords is crucial for protecting sensitive user data, as it ensures that even if a database is compromised, the original passwords cannot be easily retrieved.

Bcryptjs is specifically designed for securely hashing passwords. It employs a cryptographic hashing algorithm that is intentionally slow and resource-intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. Additionally, bcryptjs incorporates a built-in salt generation mechanism, which further enhances security by adding random data to each password before hashing, preventing identical passwords from producing the same hash.

Consider a situation where a user signs up for an online service and creates a password during the registration process. Without proper hashing, the user's password would be stored in the database in plaintext format, leaving it vulnerable to theft if the database is compromised. However, by using bcryptjs to hash the password before storing it, the **password is transformed into a cryptographically secure hash value** that cannot be reversed to reveal the original password. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the database, they would only obtain hashed passwords, which are virtually impossible to revert back to their original form.

## ‚≠ê Hashing 

Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value. This is usually represented by a shorter, fixed-length value or key that represents and makes it easier to find or employ the original string.

Hashing is a cryptographic process that transforms input data, like passwords or files, into fixed-size strings of characters known as hash values. It's deterministic, meaning the same input always produces the same hash, and it has a fixed output length. Hashing is a one-way function, making it computationally infeasible to reverse and obtain the original input from the hash value. Additionally, it aims to minimize collisions, where different inputs produce the same hash value, ensuring data integrity and security. Widely used in password storage, digital signatures, and data integrity verification, hashing plays a vital role in computer security and cryptography by securely transforming and verifying data while protecting sensitive information.

## ‚≠ê Getting started

```
npm i bcryptjs
```

### ‚ö° Writing our logic

```jsx
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs"
```

Next, we need to create an Async function that would help us work with the promises that would be returned from bcryptjs, This is because it is a promise based library. Let's create an async function.

### ‚ö° Hashing Data

Let us go ahead and create the information we are trying to hash, we'll be using user password as an example, I would create a variable for this password. We would assume it to be the plain text password our user provides to us.

```jsx
const someFunction = async() => {
    const password = "Password";
}
```
