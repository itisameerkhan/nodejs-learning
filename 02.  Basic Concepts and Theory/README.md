## What are client side and server side ?

## Client Side: 

* The client-side is the part of a web application that runs in the user's web browser. It includes the user interface and functionality that users interact with directly. Commonly written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the client-side code is executed on the user's device.

* In a Node.js context, the term "client-side" might also refer to scripts that run in the browser and interact with a Node.js server. For example, you might use Node.js to serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and handle API requests from the client-side.

* Popular client-side frameworks and libraries include React, Angular, and Vue.js. These frameworks facilitate the development of interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

## Server Side 

* The server-side is the backend or server part of a web application. It runs on a server and is responsible for processing requests, interacting with databases, and handling business logic. In a Node.js application, the server-side is typically written in JavaScript and executed on the server.

* On the server-side, Node.js applications handle tasks such as user authentication, database operations, and responding to HTTP requests. The server-side interacts with databases, external APIs, and other resources to generate dynamic content that is sent to the client-side.

**Client-Side (Browser)**: Code that runs in the user's browser, providing the user interface and interactivity.

**Server-Side (Node.js):** Code that runs on a server, handling requests, processing data, and generating dynamic content to be sent to the client.

## How Node.js uses Javascript ?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a browser environment.

**V8 Engine**: The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by the Chromium project for the Google Chrome browser. It is written in C++.

## What Developer makes with Node.js

Node.js is a versatile runtime environment that empowers developers to build a wide range of applications, from server-side web applications to command-line tools and real-time applications. Here are some common use cases and types of applications that developers build with Node.js

* Web Servers
* APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
* Microservices 
* Command-Line Tools 
* Backend for Mobile Apps
* CMS (Content Management Systems)
